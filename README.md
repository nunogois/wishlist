# Wishlist

A simple wishlist app made with [Quasar Framework](https://quasar-framework.org/)!

You can try it [here](https://wishlist-quasar.netlify.com).

This app is a PWA. If you access it using Chrome on Android, for example, it should ask you to install it.
It has offline capabilities as it uses LocalStorage but you can also sign in with Google OAuth to save your wishlist.

You can find the API [here](https://github.com/yokiharo/wishlist-api).

Feel free to contribute to the app!
