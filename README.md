# Wishlist

A simple wishlist app made with [Quasar Framework](https://quasar-framework.org/)!

You can try it [here](https://wishlist-quasar.netlify.com).

This app is a PWA. If you access it using Chrome on Android, for example, it should ask you to install it.
It also works offline as it uses LocalStorage instead of an online API.

Feel free to contribute to the app!

### Quick Start
1. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/yokiharo/wishlist.git` in a folder of your choice;
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` on the created project folder to install pre-requisites;
3. Run `quasar dev` to start developing (see Quasar Framework docs for more information!);
4. Make your changes and create a PR :smiley:
